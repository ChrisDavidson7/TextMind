TextMind is an application that enables you to upload an entire book and ask questions related to its contents. The app leverages the power of GPT-3 to provide you with answers based on the information presented in the book. One unique feature of TextMind is its capability to include the page number where the information was found, which enhances the reliability of the generated answers and makes it easier for you to locate the relevant information within the book.

To use the application you would need to provide your own OpenAI API key.
